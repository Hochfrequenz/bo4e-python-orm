This python script copies .env.example to .env if .env does not already exist.
This is similar to the shell command `cp .env.example .env`.
It is run as a CI workflow step (``uv run python -m borm.db.postgresql_db.create_env_file`` in
unittests.yml, coverage.yml, integrationtests.yml and python-publish.yml) and documented for
local setup in the README.
